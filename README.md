# personal-projects

This repo gathers different projects I do for fun and to increase my skill set, mainly in ML (with Python) and SQL. These can range from random projects I found online, to exercises from online courses and Kaggle challenges :). Kaggle challenges are machine learning competitions where data scientists compete to solve real-world problems using provided datasets, the chosen models are ultimately ranked based on a specific metric for a test set.  

For the "house prices" competition, after EDA and feature engineering, I experimented with different regression models (check the folder for more details!).

For the "titanic" competition, I was getting used to the competition's format but still managed to get a good submission with classification models. 

The "sql_data_analysis_udacity" folder contains my solutions for the Udacity Course "SQL for Data Analysis" from the basics to more advanced stuff (advanced data cleaning, window functions, perfomance tuning...)

The "sentiment_dataset" was a short project I started to learn a bit about basic NLP methods.
